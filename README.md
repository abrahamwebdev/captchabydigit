# CAPTCHA by drawing digit

A CAPTCHA is a program that protects websites against bots by
generating and grading tests that humans can pass but current computer
programs cannot.

We prompt users to draw a number shown on the
screen, it is analyzed in real time by a digit detection algorithm and we also
check for characteristics of hand drawn image.
